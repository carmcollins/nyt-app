# New York Times App

### About The Project
This web app uses HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, APIs, and AJAX to scrape the New York Times website. Users can input a search term, the number of responses they'd like to receive, and a range of dates. The app will return a list of articles that match all of the user's parameters.
